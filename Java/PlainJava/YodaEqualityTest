// Concerning the counterintuitive ordering of compared items:
// it is there to sort of function as a null check.
// Look at this fragment of code:

private static final String CHROME = "CHROME";

public void createdDriver(String browserName) {
  if (CHROME.equalsIgnoreCase(browserName)) {...}
}

// If browserName value is actually null, this condition will evaluate as 'false'.
// However, condition formulated as 'browserName.equalsIgnoreCase(CHROME)' will lead to NPE in this case.
// The same is true for equals() and in fact stems from method contracts that specify this behavior.
