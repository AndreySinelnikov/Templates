Error: Unable to load spec files quite likely because they rely on `browser` object that is not fully initialised.
`browser` object has only `capabilities` and some flags like `isMobile`.
Helper files that use other `browser` commands have to be moved to `before` hook.

COULD MEAN:

import statement "../../../importedFromHere" points to a wrong location
